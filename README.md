Predicting Hotel Booking Cancellations using Classification Techniques

Working for a large chain of international hotels and have been tasked with the job of helping the company accurately predict and respond to booking cancellations.  
To carry out this task, we use the hotel_bookings.csv data.

## Data:
- 119,390 hotel records where each record represents a single booking: hotel_bookings.csv
- Target Variable: ‘is_canceled’
- Detailed descriptions of all variables can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/sanjana08/hotel-booking-cancellation-prediction/data

## Requirements:
- Create the best possible classification model for predicting booking cancellations
- Explore all of the following models in your work
  - Logistic Regression
  - kNN
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Artificial Neural Network
- Summary:
  - Comparison of all models
  - final selection of ‘winning’ method, minimum required data and run-time information for that method.
  - A very short list of recommendations for the company. What can they do or should they do with the model provided?  Are there any concerns about the data or classification model?
- Ensure incorporation of - data cleaning, encoding categorical variables, normalization (if necessary), train-test-split, cross-validation, etc.
